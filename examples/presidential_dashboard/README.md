# Presidential Dashboard

This is a R Shiny app to show the results of US Presidential elections by precinct in Cheatham.

Notice that precinct boundaries change twice between 2000 and 2020.

* 2000 - Original shapefile
* 2010 - Redistricting every 10 years
* 2014 - The "New Hope" precinct was eliminated and voting shifted to Ashland City

A demo of this app is running on my home server at:
